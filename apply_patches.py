"""Queued edits to index.html, applied by the feed workflow before each build.

Each patch is (name, old, new). A patch is applied only if `old` is present exactly once and `new` is
absent, so running this repeatedly is safe. Once an edit is in the file it does nothing.

2026-10-04: index.html is being edited directly elsewhere, so this queue is empty on purpose and the
workflow step is a no-op. Add patches here only when nobody else is editing index.html, and pull main
first.
